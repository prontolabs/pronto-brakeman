Pronto runner for [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman), security vulnerability scanner for RoR. [What is Pronto?](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto)

## Severity mapping

Brakeman [Confidence](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman#confidence-levels) is mapped to severity levels on the
messages generated by Pronto. High confidence maps to fatal, medium confidence maps to warning, and low confidence maps
to info.

# Options
Brakeman also includes some optional checks and by setting the following in your `.pronto.yml` you can run every check included in the gem:

## Run all checks

```yaml
brakeman:
  run_all_checks: true
```

(This is the equivalent of running `brakeman -A` on the command line.)

## Ignore file

```yaml
brakeman:
  ignore_file: '.brakeman'
```

(This is the equivalent of running `brakeman -i IGNOREFILE` on the command line.)

## Interactive mode

Use this mode to [record any false positives](https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/ignoring_false_positives/) you wish to ignore.

```yaml
brakeman:
  interactive_ignore: true
```

(This is the equivalent of running `brakeman --interactive-ignore` on the command line.)
